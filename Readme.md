# Postgres-data-generator

An attempt to create an easy to use api to generate postgresql anonymous tables

## Principle of the project

Let users define what schema, links between tables, values they want to have generated (and allow it to be free and generate any number of rows)

## Why did i start making this project ? 

There are no real free to use, easy to port in a cloud infrastructure services in my mind to generate data in a lot of rows,
and i had the need.

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute if you find yourself curious / find myself doing dumb stuff, i'm quite new to development and it's my first Kotlin project (I usually do JAVA)

## Steps of developments

1. CRUD (WIP)
2. (not started) Create services and API to let users interact with the CRUD (definition of tables ...) and then use services to make the generation tool (already experimented on some scripts)
3. (not started) Deploy to Docker HUB / Make easy to use
4. (not started) Additional functionnalities : User database scan (to help keep consistency and UX) / Front end app
